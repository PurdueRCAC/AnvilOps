Thank you for installing AnvilOps!

Certificates have been automatically generated for BuildKit. They will expire in 2 years and 3 months.

To renew them, apply ./jobs/setup-certs.yaml to the cluster or reinstall the AnvilOps Helm chart. The certificates will not be regenerated when upgrading the helm chart.

{{ if .Values.harbor.install }}
An instance of the Harbor container registry has been installed and configured for you.

The admin user's username is `admin`.
You can retrieve the password by running this command:

kubectl get secret harbor-admin-password -o jsonpath='{.data.HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD}' | base64 --decode

Every time you reinstall this Helm chart, the admin password will be set to a new value, even if you have already set up Harbor with your own password.
Upgrading will not reset the admin password.
