If you would like to deploy an application on Anvil Composable, follow along at [`https://anvilops.rcac.purdue.edu`](https://anvilops.rcac.purdue.edu). If you would like to deploy on Geddes, follow these instructions on [`https://anvilops.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu`](https://anvilops.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu).

## Creating an App

### Prerequisites

- A **GitHub repository** or publicly available OCI-compliant **container image** (e.g. Docker image).
  - Singularity images are not currently supported.
- A **Rancher Project** to deploy your project inside.
  - Consult your administrator to gain access to one. A Rancher Project will serve as a workspace in which you can run applications.
  - A Project is a group of namespaces which can be configured with access controls and resource quotas.
  - If you do not have access to a Project at this time, you can deploy your application temporarily in the `anvilops_sandbox` Project.

### Deploying an App

![](./tutorial/nginx-deploy-opts.png)

Navigate to the Create App page in order to configure and launch your app. You will need to select your Project, the repository or image you would like to deploy, a subdomain, and the port number of the application.

If your app is a web application, you can make it publicly accessible at an available subdomain of your choice. Otherwise, uncheck the `Make my app public` box.

If you are deploying a Git repository, you will need to specify the build configuration.

If your repository already contains a Dockerfile, select the `Dockerfile` option and provide the path to the file. For instance, if the Dockerfile is in the root directory of your application, enter `Dockerfile`.

If your repository does not contain a Dockerfile, we encourage you to try the `Railpack` builder, which detects common application types in order to automatically build them.

For more information on available parameters, see the [configuration guide](/AnvilOps/reference/configuration).

When you click Deploy, AnvilOps will build and run your application on the cluster.
