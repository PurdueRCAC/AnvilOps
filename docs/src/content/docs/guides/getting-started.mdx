## Setting Up Your Account

<Steps>

1. [Sign in to AnvilOps](https://anvilops.rcac.purdue.edu/api/login) with your ACCESS account.

   This will create an AnvilOps account for you.

2. Navigate to the [dashboard](https://anvilops.rcac.purdue.edu/dashboard) page.
3. Link your GitHub organization or personal account.

   This will allow you to deploy applications from GitHub repositories.
   Make sure you grant the AnvilOps GitHub App permission to access the repositories you want to deploy!

</Steps>

## Creating an App

### Prerequisites

- A **GitHub repository** or publicly available OCI-compliant **container image** (e.g. Docker image) you would like to deploy.
  - Singularity images are not currently supported.
- A **Rancher Project** to deploy your project inside.
  - On Rancher, a Project is a group of namespaces which can be configured with access controls and resource quotas. Consult your administrator to gain access to one.
  - Alternatively, you can deploy your application in the `anvilops_sandbox` Project.

### Deploying an App

Navigate to the [create app](https://anvilops.rcac.purdue.edu/create-app) page in order to configure and launch your app.

Applications on AnvilOps can be configured in a number of ways. For more information on available parameters, see the [configuration guide](/reference/configuration).
